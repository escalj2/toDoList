Day-by-Day Objectives for the To-Do List App:

DONE:

    Day 1: Basic Setup
        Set up the basic Electron environment and ensure the app opens a blank window.
        Create the main index.html with a simple structure (e.g., header and buttons).

    Day 2: Modal Creation
        Implement a modal window that pops up when clicking "Add List."
        Design the modal with a title bar, text inputs for "Title" and "Note," and a "Create List" button.

    Day 3: List Creation Logic
        Implement logic so the "Create List" button logs list data in the console.
        Ensure the modal closes after clicking "Create List."

    
    Day 4: Render Lists on Screen
        When "Create List" is clicked, render the list on the main screen below the buttons.
        Style the lists nicely, so they look neat.

    Day 5: Delete List Button
        Make the "Delete List" button functional.
        Allow users to remove the last list item they added.

    Day 6: Add a Confirmation Modal
        Create a confirmation modal when deleting a list (optional, for safety).
        Style and code the "Yes" and "No" buttons inside the confirmation modal.

    Day 7: Save Lists Locally
        Use local storage to save the lists, so when the app is closed and reopened, the lists remain.
        Ensure that lists persist after relaunch.

TO DO:

    Day 8: Add Edit List Feature
        Add functionality to edit the list title or note.
        Implement an "Edit" button next to each list item.

    Day 9: Polish UI
        Improve the visual design of the app.
        Center the elements, add spacing, and fine-tune colors to make it look slick.

    Day 10: Bug Fixes and Testing

    Test the app for any bugs.
    Ensure all buttons, modals, and list actions work flawlessly.
